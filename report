Problem and Solution:

England has a very unstable economic situation because of its decision to leave the European Union.
In such a situation, making profitable decisions about buying (investing) real estate is very difficult and risky.
We will try to create a system that can recommend us the most profitable and least risky proposal
for investing in real estate, taking into account infrastructure.

Section data:
We will use api foursquare for London and Land Registry Base (http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/).
So we have:
Postcode
PAON Primary Addressable Object Name
Typically the house number or name
SAON Secondary Addressable Object Name
If there is a sub-building, for example
the building is divided into flats
there will be a SAON
Street
Locality
Town/City
District
County
API
Etc...
